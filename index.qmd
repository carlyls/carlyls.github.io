# About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://biostat.duke.edu/) and the [Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI)](https://dcri.org/) at Duke University. I graduated in the spring of 2024 with my PhD in Biostatistics from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, advised by [Dr. Elizabeth Stuart](https://www.elizabethstuart.org/). I am a methodological and applied biostatistician - my methods focuses are primarily causal inference, treatment effect heterogeneity, data integration/fusion, and machine learning, and my applied interests include women's health, mental health, sport science, and aging.
